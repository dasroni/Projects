### Description:

 There are many parts to the project. Final stage of the project describes *Metropolis Alogrithm* using Matlab.
 Realizations of a Random Process were acquired using a simple set of steps described by Metropolis Algorithm, namely,
 Proposal Distribution, accept or reject samples based on Acceptance probability. Stochastic properties of Markovian Chanins 
were observed and data ploted using MatLab.      

### Resources:
   **src** folder contains all the MatLab *Source Codes* for this projects, along with plotted *realizations*. 

**Project_Report.pdf** contains detailed descriptions of the projects from earlier parts.
