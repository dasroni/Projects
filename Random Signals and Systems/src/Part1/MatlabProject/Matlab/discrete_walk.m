function [x,t_final] = discrete_walk(height,width,x_initial,x_final)
% Please fill in the function. The function should simulate a discrete
% uniform random walk on a (height x width) grid. The origin of the grid
% (bottom left corner) is always [0,0]. The function should assume that
% X[1]=x_initial and will simulate the random walk until X[t]=x_final. 

% Inputs to the function
% height - vertical length of the grid
% width  - horizontal length of the grid]
% x_initial - starting point in the random walk
% x_final - end the random walk when X[t] reaches this point

% Outputs to the function
% x - a matrix of the positions at each iteration of the random walk
% t_final - number of iterations it took until X[t]=x_final
