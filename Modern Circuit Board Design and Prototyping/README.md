### Description:

   The goal of this project is to assimilate into the world of Printed Circuit Board. A system, *Gas Detector* is
conceptualized, which detects harmful natural gas from enviorment. Using *AutoDesk Eagle PCB Software*, the system is 
designed and parts ordered online. *Fusion 360*, is used in designing and printing an enclosure for this system.    

### Resources:
   **src** folder contains all the source codes for this project. *Object* files for printing enclosure is under
**3D_Case** folder. While the *Gerber Files* , of designed PCB can be found under **EagleProject** folder, along with *BOM* file for parts.
