### Description:

*Senior Design Project*, is a year long effort of applying engineering knowledge from different curriculum in a single
project. Under the supervision of faculty member, each steps of this project is thoroughly revised. My *Senior Design Project*, 
is comprised of making a **Smart Stove** capable of connecting online and supported by mobile application. House fires are major 
cause of loss of lives and billons of dollars in property damage. **Smart Stove** is an IOT system finds answer to this problem. 
Full Report on the project can be found in **404!_FinalReport.pdf**.        
 

### Resources:
   This Directory contains all the required documents I needed to prepare for *Senior Design*. This is a year long effort of finding 
engineering soulution for a specific problem. All the documents from *Proposal* to *Final Report* can be found here, along with designed 
*Poster*. Requirements and ideas have changed over the course of this project, therefore, *Proposal* won't reflect the final 
product. For **Final Product**, please read **404!_FinalReport.pdf**.   


### Note:
   Due to COVID-19 outbreak, as Computer Engineering Student, we were severly restricted in accessing lab equipments and other 
resources required to to complete this project. However, we managed to finished the project by sourcing individual materials outside of school
and making a home lab ourselves. Originally, **Final Product** is thought to be a finished PCB with 3D printed enclosure. Although designs were
made using AutoDesk Eagle PCB software, we had to omit placing PCB order.
