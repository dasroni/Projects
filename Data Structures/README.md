### Description:
   
  * **Bash Terminal**
        <p>*Bash Terminal* is a linux based terminal coded in Java. User running this program can
        create, move, modify, remove directories or files from working directories using standard shell 
        commnands such as *pwd*,*ls*, *mkdir*, *touch* etc. Program's internal data structure is based on *Tree*, where 
        routine tree walks are need in keeping files/directories in order.  <p>
 * **Python Tracer**
        <p>*Python Tracer* is a Java based program that examines python block codes in determing runtime of the codes in **O(n)** notation.
         Python codes Block complexity is determined based on indentations and nests of loops used in codes.<p>
 * **Router Simulator**
        <p>*Router Simulator* is a Java based program that simulates how packets of data gets passed around inside a typical network router. 
        *Queue* is the underlying data structure used in modeling this simulator.<p>
 * **Search Engine**
        <p>*Search Engine* is a Java based program that mimics a generic web search engine. Program reads a file containing URLs, links and builds 
        a *Web Graph* of these pages. A page (eg. Google), with a large # of incoming links (pointed by other pages) will appear higher in search order.
        User can search for keywords within pages or URL's , also add/remove URLs and links from *Web Graph*, simulating publishing a website. <p>

### Resources:
   This directory contains **4** separate projects from Data Structure class, aka, CSE 214. Under each of the
four project's folder contains all the *Source codes* for respective project. As per project's requirement,
Java programming language is used in coding all the projects.
