### Description:

 There are total of **3** parts of the project. Each part build on the knowlege and skills acquired from 
previous parts. The final project (part3) is about designing 8-bit row decoder in Dynamic Combinational
CMOS logic using Cadence Virtuoso design software. Each transistor is sized using given specifiation and
gates designed in "Domino logic". Various simulations of propagation delay were measured and results compared
against "static logic" design.
